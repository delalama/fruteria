The exercise to be carried out consists of setting up a fruit shop. The store will have a series of products.
Each product will have a value. For example:

Pears 0.75€
Apples 0.9€
Oranges 1€

You can add offers for each product. Continuing with the previous example:

Buy 3 Apples and pay 2.
Get a free Orange for every 2 Pears you buy.
For every 4 € spent on Pears, we will deduct one euro from your final invoice.

The entry of the application must be:

-A file where the products and prices are specified similar to

PRODUCT,PRICE
Pear, 0.75
Apple,0.9
Orange,1

-A file describing a purchase, of the style

PRODUCT, QUANTITY
Pear,3
Orange, 25
Apple, 12

The output must be a receipt with:

The total price, the list of products purchased, the offers applied. It can be in a file or per output per console.


You only have 3 hours to perform the exercise from the moment you receive it by mail.
We expect an executable file and a series of code files sent via a GitHub link.
Anything to be assumed must be commented on in a readme that you can elaborate after 3 hours to do the exercise (in that case the readme must be sent in a different mail to that of the exercise).
The programming language should be Java and all file names and variables must be in English.
The organization of the code, which is easy to expand and understand, will be valued above all.
The quality of the structure will be valued more than the total completeness of the exercise and its functionality.


¡Good luck!
